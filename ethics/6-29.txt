Individual project ideas:
- use powerpoint for base video + animations then add blender audio + extra animation.
    - "this happened then this happened then this happened" format could be nice


BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster:
    - An oil drilling platform (not anchored - can move anywhere)
    - made in South Korea
    - Owned by different company (Transocean)
    - Leased to BP
    -Disaster:
        - Blowout:
            - pressure reverses and oil/gas bursts through the piping
            - it then caught on fire
                - the results were disasterous (pipe broke after it fell over and even more oil/gas burst out)
